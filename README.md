## Objectives:

Create a simple e-commerce product page using React.js that allows users to view product
details, manage a shopping cart, and add products to a wishlist. You can select the type of
store you'd like to create the webpage for, such as electronics, fashion, books, or any other
category. This assignment provides hands-on experience with React, including component
structure, state management, props, React Hooks, and basic routing, while simulating
real-world e-commerce functionality.
